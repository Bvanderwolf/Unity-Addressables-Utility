Created during a week free of work. 

The focus of this utility is to help with managing remote catalogs. 

As we work a lot with addressables in our company I encountered many problems trying to understand this extensive package. Specifically with Remote Catalogs. 

Contains:
- AddressableContent: The core reusable functionalities
- AddressableContentSystem: An example implementation of a system class that would use the core reusable functionalities
- RequestResult: Some generic structs for storing the received data from callbacks

Use as you'd like.
